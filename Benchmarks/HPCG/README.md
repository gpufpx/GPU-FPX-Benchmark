# Description
NVIDIA official cuda-hpcg benchmarks

## Link 
https://www.hpcg-benchmark.org/software/index.html

## Information
This benchmark is updated regularly. We are not using the latest docker container but the `
HPCG 3.1 Binary for NVIDIA GPUs Including Ampere based on CUDA 11` binary since it is easier to apply GPU-FPX. 

# ToDo
Check if it could run at Turing architecture.
